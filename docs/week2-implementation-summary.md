## 🔄 How It Works Together

### Complete Learning Flow

```
1. User starts new sprint
   ↓
2. Pre-sprint quiz generated (if required)
   ↓
3. User takes quiz → Must pass (80%+) to start

6. User takes quiz → Must pass to progress
   ↓
7. Skill levels updated based on quiz performance
   ↓
8. Review schedule created/updated for each skill
   ↓
9. System checks if review sprint needed
   ↓
10. If 3+ skills overdue → Insert review sprint
    ↓
11. User completes review sprint
    ↓
12. Review intervals adjusted based on performance
    ↓
13. Cycle continues...
```
