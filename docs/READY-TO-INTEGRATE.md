## ⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Option 1: Minimal Integration (Recommended to Start)

Add **ONE LINE** to your sprint completion handler:

```typescript
// File: src/services/sprintCompletionHandler.ts
import brainAdaptiveIntegration from './brainAdaptiveIntegration.js';

// After marking sprint complete, add this:
await brainAdaptiveIntegration.processSprintCompletion({
  sprintId,
  userId,
  score: updatedSprint.score || 0,
  completionData,
}).catch(err => console.error('Brain-adaptive failed:', err));
```

**That's it!** This enables:
- ✅ Automatic skill tracking
- ✅ Adaptive difficulty adjustment
- ✅ Performance analysis
- ✅ Review scheduling
- ✅ Personalized notifications

**Test it:**
1. Complete a sprint
2. Check console for `[Brain-Adaptive]` logs
3. Check database: `SELECT * FROM user_skills WHERE userId = 'your-user-id'`
4. Complete 3 more sprints with high scores (>90%)
5. Watch difficulty increase automatically! 🚀

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test 1: Skill Tracking
```bash
# Complete a sprint
POST /api/sprints/:sprintId/complete

# Check skills were tracked
SELECT * FROM user_skills WHERE userId = 'your-user-id';

# Expected: 3-5 skills with levels 20-60
```

### Test 2: Adaptive Difficulty (Speed Up)
```bash
# Complete 3 sprints with high scores (>90%)
POST /api/sprints/:sprint1/complete { score: 95 }
POST /api/sprints/:sprint2/complete { score: 92 }
POST /api/sprints/:sprint3/complete { score: 94 }

# Check adaptation
SELECT * FROM objective_adaptations WHERE objectiveId = 'your-objective-id';

# Expected: velocityMultiplier = 1.3, difficultyLevel = 70
```

### Test 3: Adaptive Difficulty (Slow Down)
```bash
# Complete 2 sprints with low scores (<70%)
POST /api/sprints/:sprint1/complete { score: 65 }
POST /api/sprints/:sprint2/complete { score: 68 }

# Check adaptation
SELECT * FROM objective_adaptations WHERE objectiveId = 'your-objective-id';

# Expected: velocityMultiplier = 0.7, difficultyLevel = 30
```

### Test 4: Spaced Repetition
```bash
# Complete a sprint
POST /api/sprints/:sprintId/complete

# Check review schedules created
SELECT * FROM review_schedules WHERE userId = 'your-user-id';

# Expected: 3-5 schedules with nextReviewAt in 1-7 days
```

### Test 5: Quiz Generation
```bash
# Generate quiz
POST /api/sprints/:sprintId/generate-quiz

# Get quiz
GET /api/sprints/:sprintId/quiz

# Submit quiz
POST /api/sprints/:sprintId/quiz/submit
{
  "answers": [...],
  "timeSpent": 180
}

# Expected: Auto-graded with score, skill scores, recommendations
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 1. Non-Breaking
- ✅ Fully backward compatible
- ✅ Graceful degradation (if AI fails, continues)
- ✅ All features wrapped in try-catch
- ✅ Won't break existing flow

### 2. Performance
- Adds ~5-7s to sprint completion (mostly AI calls)
- Can be made async if needed
- Database queries are optimized

### 3. AI Costs
- Skill extraction: ~$0.001 per sprint
- Quiz generation: ~$0.002 per quiz
- Adaptation: ~$0.001 per analysis
- **Total: ~$0.01 per sprint** (negligible)

### 4. Database

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start Small
Don't integrate everything at once. Start with:
1. Skill tracking only
2. Then add adaptive difficulty
3. Then add quizzes
4. Then add spaced repetition

### Tip 2: Monitor Logs
Watch for `[Brain-Adaptive]` logs to see what's happening:
```
🧠 Processing sprint completion
📚 Extracting skills
✅ Updated 3 skills
📈 Performance: 91.2% (improving)
🎯 Adaptation applied: increase
```

### Tip 3: Check Database
Regularly check these tables:
- `user_skills` - Are skills being tracked?
- `objective_adaptations` - Is difficulty adjusting?
- `review_schedules` - Are reviews scheduled?

### Tip 4: User Feedback
Ask users:
- "Do you feel the difficulty is appropriate?"
- "Are you learning faster?"
- "Do the quizzes help you learn?"
- "Do you remember what you learned?"
