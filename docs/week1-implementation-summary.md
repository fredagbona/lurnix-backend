## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### **Phase 1: Skill Tracking System** ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ Created `Skill` model with hierarchy support
- ✅ Created `UserSkill` model for tracking individual skill progress (0-100 levels)
- ✅ Created `SprintSkill` model for linking skills to sprints
- ✅ Added skill-related enums: `SkillDifficulty`, `SkillStatus`
- ✅ Migration applied successfully: `20251001151125_add_brain_adaptive_learning_system`

**Tables Created:**
- `skills` - Master skill database (56 skills seeded)
- `user_skills` - User-specific skill progress tracking
- `sprint_skills` - Sprint-skill relationships

#### 1.2 SkillTrackingService

- ✅ `updateSkillsFromSprint()` - Batch update skills from sprint completion
- ✅ `detectStrugglingAreas()` - Identify skills where user is struggling
- ✅ `getSkillsDueForReview()` - Get skills needing review (spaced repetition)

**Key Algorithms:**
- **Level Calculation**: Performance-based with diminishing returns at higher levels
- **Status Determination**: 6 statuses (not_started, learning, practicing, proficient, mastered, struggling)
- **Spaced Repetition**: Simplified SM-2 algorithm for review scheduling

- ✅ Created `SprintAdaptation` model for tracking sprint-level difficulty adjustments
- ✅ Added adaptive learning fields to `Objective` model:
  - `learningVelocity` (multiplier, default 1.0)
  - `currentDifficulty` (0-100 scale, default 50)
  - `lastRecalibrationAt`
  - `recalibrationCount`
- ✅ Added adaptive fields to `Sprint` model:
  - `targetSkills` (array of skill IDs)
  - `difficultyScore` (0-100 scale)
  - `adaptedFrom` (increased/decreased/maintained)
  - `adaptationReason`

**Tables Created:**
- `objective_adaptations` - History of objective recalibrations
- `sprint_adaptations` - History of sprint difficulty adjustments

#### 2.2 AdaptiveLearningService
**File:** `src/services/adaptiveLearningService.ts`

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ `analyzePerformance()` - Analyze recent sprint performance
- ✅ `recalibrateLearningPath()` - AI-powered path recalibration
- ✅ `adjustNextSprintDifficulty()` - Adjust upcoming sprint difficulty
- ✅ `adjustEstimatedDays()` - Recalculate total days based on velocity

**Adaptation Rules:**
1. **Speed Up**: If avg score > 90% for 3+ sprints
   - Increase difficulty by 15-20 points
   - Increase velocity by 20-30%
   - Add advanced concepts, skip basics

2. **Slow Down**: If avg score < 70% for 2+ sprints
   - Decrease difficulty by 15-20 points
   - Decrease velocity by 20-30%
   - Add more examples, break down concepts

3. **Maintain**: If scores are 70-90%
   - Keep current difficulty and pace

**AI Integration:**
- Uses Groq for intelligent adaptation decisions
- Fallback to rule-based adaptation if AI fails
- Considers trend, struggling skills, mastered skills

- Performance score (0-100)
- Practice type (introduction/practice/review/mastery)
- Current level (diminishing returns)
- Consecutive failures (penalty)

### 3. Adaptation Decision
AI-powered with rule-based fallback:
- Analyzes last 5 sprints
- Considers trend (improving/stable/declining)
- Factors in struggling/mastered skills
- Adjusts difficulty and velocity
- Recalculates estimated days
