# Adaptive Quiz System - Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-03  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

---

## üéØ Overview

Successfully implemented the adaptive quiz system endpoints for the brain-adaptive learning feature. The system enables pre-sprint readiness checks, post-sprint validation, and detailed quiz performance tracking.

---

## üì¶ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Validation Schemas** ‚úÖ
**File:** `/src/schemas/adaptiveQuizSchemas.ts`

- `submitQuizAnswersSchema` - Validates quiz submission with answers and time spent
- `quizIdParamSchema` - Validates quiz ID parameter
- `sprintIdParamSchema` - Validates sprint ID parameter

### 2. **Controller** ‚úÖ
**File:** `/src/controllers/adaptiveQuizController.ts`

Implemented 6 endpoints:

#### Quiz Endpoints
- **`getQuiz`** - Get quiz by ID with all questions
- **`submitQuiz`** - Submit quiz answers and get results with skill-level performance
- **`getUserQuizAttempts`** - Get all attempts for a specific quiz
- **`getQuizAttempt`** - Get detailed results of a specific attempt

#### Sprint Validation Endpoints
- **`checkSprintReadiness`** - Check if user can start sprint (pre-sprint quiz validation)
- **`checkSprintValidation`** - Check if user can progress (post-sprint quiz validation)

### 3. **Routes** ‚úÖ
**File:** `/src/routes/adaptiveQuizRoutes.ts`

Configured routes with:
- Authentication middleware
- Request validation
- Swagger documentation
- Proper error handling

### 4. **Router Registration** ‚úÖ
**File:** `/src/routes/index.ts`

Registered adaptive quiz routes at `/api/quizzes`

### 5. **Documentation** ‚úÖ
**File:** `/docs/integration-front-system-learning.md`

Updated with implementation status and backend details

## üîê Security & Validation

### Authentication
- All endpoints protected with `authenticate` middleware
- User ID extracted from JWT token
- Ownership validation for quiz attempts

### Request Validation
- Zod schemas validate all inputs
- UUID format validation for IDs
- Answer format validation (string, array, boolean)
- Time spent validation (positive integer)

### Error Handling
- Proper HTTP status codes (200, 400, 401, 403, 404)
- Consistent error response format
- Descriptive error messages
- Graceful handling of edge cases

## üß™ Integration with Brain-Adaptive System

The quiz endpoints integrate seamlessly with:

1. **Knowledge Validation Service** - Handles quiz grading and skill tracking
2. **Skill Tracking Service** - Updates skill levels based on quiz performance
3. **Adaptive Learning Service** - Uses quiz results for difficulty adjustment
4. **Spaced Repetition Service** - Schedules reviews based on quiz performance

## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Get quiz questions endpoint
- [ ] Submit quiz with correct answers (pass)
- [ ] Submit quiz with incorrect answers (fail)
- [ ] Check attempts remaining after submission
- [ ] Test sprint readiness with no quiz
- [ ] Test sprint readiness with required quiz
- [ ] Test sprint validation after completion
- [ ] Get quiz attempt details

- [ ] Access another user's quiz attempt (403)
- [ ] Submit invalid quiz ID (404)
- [ ] Submit malformed answers (400)
- [ ] Check readiness for non-existent sprint (404)
